# Flappy-Bird-AI

This project is developed as a BÄ°L 441 course project in TOBB ETU. 
The motivation behind the project is to implement Artificial Intelligence somehow to an existed Flappy Bird game.

<h2> Abstract </h2>
Artificial intelligence has become increasingly popular in recent years and has gained positive development momentum.
It is a preferable method to implement AI to the existed games in the introduction stages of AI learning process.
This project is about how to create an Intelligent Agent that can finish the Flappy Bird game itself.
